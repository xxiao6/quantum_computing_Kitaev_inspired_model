Code for symmetry-enforced circuit measuring entanglement spectra and entropy

When we measure the entanglement entropy of a finite system, the quantum information of the original model usually will not be extract completely due to the finite size effects. Here the symmetry-enforced circuit is constructed based on the idea of the twised boundary conditions Proposed by Niu, Wu and Thouless. By using the twist angle as the tuning parameter, the quantum information of the original model can be completely explored by this circuit.
